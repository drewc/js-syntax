#+TITLE: Customization, not everything is JS

The very first line of our very first test parser contains an invalid token.
Here's where we allow such things.

#+begin_src gerbil :tangle "custom-token.ss"
  (import :std/misc/list :drewc/smug)
  (export #t)

  (def HashtagLang (.let* ((_ "#lang ") (v (.read-line))) `(|#lang|, v)))

  (def Annotation (.let* (a #\@) (return 'Annotation)))

  (def custom-tokens [HashtagLang Annotation])

  (def (lex-custom-tokens) (apply .or custom-tokens))

  (def CustomToken (.let* (ct (lex-custom-tokens)) (return ct)))
#+end_src
